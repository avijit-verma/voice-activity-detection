# Voice Activity Detection

This is a project for creating Voice Activity Detection systems using MATLAB. 
I completed this project as part of my "Signals and Systems" Course during my undergrad.

The aim is to detect voiced, unvoiced and noisy portions of a speech signal using different parameters such as:

1. Auto-Correlation of the signal.
2. Energy of the signal. 
3. Magnitude of the signal.
4. Zero Crossing Points of the signal.

Performance measures have also been noted to assess the impact of each parameter.
